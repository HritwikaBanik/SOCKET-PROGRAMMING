# SOCKET PROGRAMMING
This project involved developing a TCP client-server application that enables basic message exchange over a network. The server was implemented to listen on a configurable port, accept multiple client connections, receive messages, and respond with an acknowledgment ("Message received"). The client successfully connects to the server using an IP and port, sends user-defined messages, and displays the serverâ€™s acknowledgment.  Dynamic memory allocation was used for message buffers, and memory management was carefully handled using both manual (new/delete) and smart pointers (std::unique_ptr) where appropriate. The application was tested using Valgrind, confirming there are no memory leaks or issues with resource cleanup.  In summary, the project successfully demonstrates a working TCP communication system with proper memory safety practices.
